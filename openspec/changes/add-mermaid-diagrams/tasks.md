# Tasks: Add Mermaid Diagrams

## Implementation Order

### 1. Design Diagrams
- [ ] Design state transition diagram showing calculator state flow
- [ ] Design architecture diagram showing component relationships
- [ ] Design user interaction flowchart for button click sequences
- [ ] Design file structure diagram for project organization
- **Validation**: All diagrams are sketched out and reviewed for accuracy

### 2. Create State Flow Diagram
- [ ] Add Mermaid state diagram to design.md showing state transitions
- [ ] Include all calculator states (initial, waitingForSecondOperand, error, result)
- [ ] Show transitions between states with trigger events
- [ ] Add labels for state variables (currentDisplay, firstOperand, operator)
- **Validation**: Diagram syntax is valid and renders correctly in Mermaid preview

### 3. Create Architecture Diagram
- [ ] Add Mermaid graph diagram showing component architecture
- [ ] Show HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components
- [ ] Illustrate data flow between components
- [ ] Include event delegation pattern
- **Validation**: Diagram accurately represents the calculator architecture

### 4. Create User Interaction Flowchart
- [ ] Add Mermaid flowchart showing user interaction paths
- [ ] Document number input flow
- [ ] Document operator selection flow
- [ ] Document calculation and result display flow
- [ ] Show error handling paths (division by zero)
- **Validation**: Flowchart covers all major user scenarios

### 5. Create File Structure Diagram
- [ ] Add Mermaid graph showing project file structure
- [ ] Show relationships between files (imports, links)
- [ ] Include brief descriptions of each file's purpose
- **Validation**: Diagram matches actual project structure

### 6. Update README.md
- [ ] Add "Architecture" section with architecture diagram
- [ ] Add "State Management" section with state flow diagram
- [ ] Ensure diagrams render correctly in markdown preview
- [ ] Update table of contents if needed
- **Validation**: README renders correctly with diagrams on GitHub/viewer

### 7. Update design.md
- [ ] Enhance "Architecture Overview" section with architecture diagram
- [ ] Enhance "State Transitions" section with state flow diagram
- [ ] Add user interaction flowchart to relevant section
- [ ] Ensure consistency with existing text descriptions
- **Validation**: design.md diagrams complement existing documentation

### 8. Documentation and Validation
- [ ] Add comments explaining complex diagram sections
- [ ] Verify all Mermaid syntax is correct
- [ ] Test diagram rendering in multiple viewers (GitHub, VS Code, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure diagrams are accessible (have descriptive alt text where supported)
- **Validation**: All diagrams render correctly across platforms

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Tasks 2, 3, 4, and 5 (creating individual diagrams) can be worked on in parallel
- Tasks 6 and 7 (updating documentation files) should be done after diagrams are created

## Dependencies
- Task 1 should complete before other tasks begin
- Tasks 2-5 must complete before Tasks 6-7
- Task 8 should be done after all diagrams are added
