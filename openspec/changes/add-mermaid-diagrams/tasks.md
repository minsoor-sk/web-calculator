# Tasks: Add Mermaid Diagrams

## Implementation Order

### 1. Design Diagrams
- [x] Design state transition diagram showing calculator state flow
- [x] Design architecture diagram showing component relationships
- [x] Design user interaction flowchart for button click sequences
- [x] Design file structure diagram for project organization
- **Validation**: All diagrams are sketched out and reviewed for accuracy ✅

### 2. Create State Flow Diagram
- [x] Add Mermaid state diagram to design.md showing state transitions
- [x] Include all calculator states (initial, waitingForSecondOperand, error, result)
- [x] Show transitions between states with trigger events
- [x] Add labels for state variables (currentDisplay, firstOperand, operator)
- **Validation**: Diagram syntax is valid and renders correctly in Mermaid preview ✅

### 3. Create Architecture Diagram
- [x] Add Mermaid graph diagram showing component architecture
- [x] Show HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components
- [x] Illustrate data flow between components
- [x] Include event delegation pattern
- **Validation**: Diagram accurately represents the calculator architecture ✅

### 4. Create User Interaction Flowchart
- [x] Add Mermaid flowchart showing user interaction paths
- [x] Document number input flow
- [x] Document operator selection flow
- [x] Document calculation and result display flow
- [x] Show error handling paths (division by zero)
- **Validation**: Flowchart covers all major user scenarios ✅

### 5. Create File Structure Diagram
- [x] Add Mermaid graph showing project file structure
- [x] Show relationships between files (imports, links)
- [x] Include brief descriptions of each file's purpose
- **Validation**: Diagram matches actual project structure ✅

### 6. Update README.md
- [x] Add "Architecture" section with architecture diagram
- [x] Add "State Management" section with state flow diagram
- [x] Ensure diagrams render correctly in markdown preview
- [x] Update table of contents if needed
- **Validation**: README renders correctly with diagrams on GitHub/viewer ✅

### 7. Update design.md
- [x] Enhance "Architecture Overview" section with architecture diagram
- [x] Enhance "State Transitions" section with state flow diagram
- [x] Add user interaction flowchart to relevant section
- [x] Ensure consistency with existing text descriptions
- **Validation**: design.md diagrams complement existing documentation ✅

### 8. Documentation and Validation
- [x] Add comments explaining complex diagram sections
- [x] Verify all Mermaid syntax is correct
- [x] Test diagram rendering in multiple viewers (GitHub, VS Code, etc.)
- [x] Ensure diagrams are accessible (have descriptive alt text where supported)
- **Validation**: All diagrams render correctly across platforms ✅

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Tasks 2, 3, 4, and 5 (creating individual diagrams) can be worked on in parallel
- Tasks 6 and 7 (updating documentation files) should be done after diagrams are created

## Dependencies
- Task 1 should complete before other tasks begin
- Tasks 2-5 must complete before Tasks 6-7
- Task 8 should be done after all diagrams are added
